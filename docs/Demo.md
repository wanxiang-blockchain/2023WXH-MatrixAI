#### *Mockups / UI design*

We have currently completed the prototype design and a majority of the UI design. Moving forward, we will continue to enhance interactions and event feedback within the pages. The main pages that have been completed are showcased as follows:

1. _Computing Power Marketplace_
![image](https://github.com/MatrixAI-Lab/Grants-Program/assets/141611559/ede93c61-315a-4270-a268-2b9ea4af3f0d)


- Users can query the device information and pricing of computing power providers on this page.
- Users can filter devices based on conditions such as the number and model of graphics cards, the device's location, and pricing.
- Display the reliability of each miner and the device performance index.

2. _Edit Model_

- Users utilize this page to submit orders for the usage of computing power devices.
- After defining the task content, dataset, and parameters for model training, the next step involves automatically estimating the duration of the training process.

3. _Share Device_

- Once computing power providers run the MatrixAI client on their servers, the device information will be displayed on this page.
- Display device information and the current status of the device.

4. _My Orders_
![image4](https://github.com/MatrixAI-Lab/Grants-Program/assets/141611559/6f527017-c540-47d4-a4ac-014f089edb2a)

- Display current and historical orders.
- Display the status of orders. For incomplete orders, users can perform actions on the model training tasks.

5. _Order Details_
![image5](https://github.com/MatrixAI-Lab/Grants-Program/assets/141611559/790c6c4d-e3db-424e-8a75-d9fe01fda05c)


- Display detailed information about orders, including device information, task details, and information from the blockchain.

6. _Console_
![image6](https://github.com/MatrixAI-Lab/Grants-Program/assets/141611559/ed1253e7-596e-490a-9abc-1eb543f9948b)


- Users can optimize model training parameters.

7. _Tasking Log_
![image7](https://github.com/MatrixAI-Lab/Grants-Program/assets/141611559/4043857d-94db-40e0-8ee9-d46ffea4b6b3)


- Display logs of model training tasks.

8. _Faucet_
